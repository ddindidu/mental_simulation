    **Perspective:**
    - Write in third-person
    - Refer to the patient as "The patient" or "A [Age]-year-old [Gender]"

    **Patient Demographics:**
    - Include age, gender, marital status, occupation in the opening
    - Avoid temporal modifiers (e.g., "recently retired", "newly divorced")
    - IMPORTANT: Provided demographics are NOT stressors or causes of symptoms
    - For potentially stressor-like demographics (e.g., retirement, divorce, bereavement):
        a. Add a statement showing clear temporal separation between the demographic event and symptom onset
        b. The demographic event should have occurred significantly earlier than symptom onset

    **Terminology & Tone:**
    - Use standard medical terminology (avoid patient slang)
    - Maintain an objective, clinical tone

    **Constraints:**
    - Do not reveal the diagnosis name
    - Do not directly quote or copy the provided symptom descriptions

    **Requirements:**
    - Include the duration in clinical format
    - Incorporate all provided symptom categories as clinical observations
